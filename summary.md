My program is an artist guessing game where the user has to guess the music artist based on three things: their country of origin, gender, the genre of music they make, and whether they are a solo, duo, or a band. So far I have only written the part that is supposed to read out all the information and some messages that greet the user. I plan to make the part that chooses the random artist that the user has to guess. I also have plans to create a scoring system where the user can see how many artists they guessed correctly and which ones they failed to guess.
